# A set is a collection of unique data. That is, elements of a set cannot be duplicated.
# Sets are unordered, meaning that the elements do not have a defined order, and you cannot access them using an index.
# Sets are mutable, meaning that you can add or remove elements from a set after it has been created.
# Sets are defined using curly braces {} or the set() function.
# Example of creating a set
